## Bug fixes

* Fix possible compilation errors happening when inheriting from a schema containing fields with options
* Fix an issue where model field validations were inconsistent with validation callbacks (eg. model field validations were called before `before_validation` callbacks)
* Ensure that exception messages and snippet lines are properly escaped in the server error debug page
