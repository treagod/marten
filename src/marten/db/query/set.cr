      # A query set is an object that matches a collection of records in the database. Those objects are matched through
      # the use of optional filters that allow to explicitly query the database based on specific parameters. Query sets
      # also allow to configure how these objects should be returned (for example in which order).
      #
      # The most important characteristic of a query set is that it is lazily evaluated: unless the code that resulted
      # in the creation of the query set explicitly asks for the underlying objects, no actual query is made to the
      # considered database. Querying the database is always deferred to the last possible moment: that is, when the
      # actual records are requested.
