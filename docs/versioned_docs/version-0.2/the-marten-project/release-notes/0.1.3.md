## Bug fixes

* Ensure that before/after deletion callbacks are executed in the same transaction as the deletion runner
* Add missing `.gitignore` file to projects generated through the use of the [`new`](../../development/reference/management-commands.md#new) management command
* Fix incorrect host used for development environments when generating new projects through the use of the [`new`](../../development/reference/management-commands.md#new) management command: now, projects automatically use the `127.0.0.1` local host in development
* Ensure that the [flash context producer](../../templates/reference/context-producers.md#flash-context-producer) takes into account requests that don't have an associated flash store in order to avoid unexpected `NilAssertionError` exceptions
