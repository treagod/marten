## Bug fixes

* Fix possible inconsistencies in results returned by query sets based on the order of calls to [`#filter`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#filter) and [`#exclude`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#exclude).
* Fix invalid through model generation for recursive [many-to-many relationships](../../models-and-databases/introduction.md#many-to-many-relationships).
* Ensure that `#<field>?` model methods return false for empty field values.
* Add missing `#<field>?` method for [`file`](../../models-and-databases/reference/fields.md#file) model fields.
