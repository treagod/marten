## Bug fixes

* Fix a bug where some types returned by built-in fields weren't allowed as template values
* Fix a bug where it was not possible to resolve UUID routing parameters from valid UUID strings
* Ensure abstract model classes can be created without primary key fields
* Ensure subclasses of [`Marten::Conf::Setting`](pathname:///api/0.1/Marten/Conf/Settings.html) no longer have to define a mandatory `#initialize` method if they don't need to
